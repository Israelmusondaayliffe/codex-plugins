# Consistency Constraints

Positive and negative constraint language that reliably improves AI video output. Harvested from high-performing community prompts. Attach to any shot prompt where the risk applies.

## Character Consistency

- "Consistent face across all shots"
- "Identical facial features, no drift"
- "Stable proportions, no deformation"
- "Same clothing, same hairstyle, same build throughout"
- "Preserve identity anchors: [specific features like scar, tattoo, glasses]"
- "No morphing, no identity swap between shots"

## Physical / Material Physics

- "Realistic gravity, consistent weight"
- "Accurate material response on impact"
- "Fabric moves with believable drape and momentum"
- "Water flows with physical accuracy"
- "Hair physics match head motion naturally"
- "Shadows consistent with light source throughout"

## Anatomical Integrity

- "Normal human body structure"
- "Correct finger count and hand anatomy"
- "Natural joint articulation"
- "No extra limbs, no fused digits"
- "Proportions stay stable through motion"

## Visual Quality

- "4K sharp, no blur artifacts"
- "No flicker, no ghosting"
- "No temporal artifacts between frames"
- "Clean motion, no stuttering"
- "Stable composition, no unwanted drift"

## Scene Continuity

- "Lighting direction consistent across cuts"
- "Color temperature stable throughout"
- "Background elements remain in position between shots"
- "Props and set pieces do not morph"
- "Camera physics believable, no impossible moves"

## Usage Pattern

Insert after the main shot description, before any transition or audio note. Format as a concise clause:

```
...medium close-up, slow dolly-in. Constraints: consistent face, stable proportions, no deformation, realistic fabric physics. Audio: soft breathing, ambient room tone.
```

Stack 3-5 constraints per shot. More than 5 dilutes attention. Pick the ones that address the specific risk in that shot.
