# BUILD Templates (Text-to-Video)

Five template scaffolds distilled from high-engagement community prompts. Each covers a distinct use case. Adapt language, do not fill mechanically.

## T1. Cinematic Narrative

```
[Subject description] [action sequence] in [environment]. [00-05s] Shot 1: [description]. [05-10s] Shot 2: [description]. [10-15s] Shot 3: [description]. Camera: [movement, e.g. smooth tracking, slow dolly-in]. Style: [cinematic descriptors, e.g. ultra-realistic, 35mm anamorphic, film grain]. Lighting: [e.g. golden hour volumetric]. Constraints: consistent face, no deformation, realistic physics. Audio: [diegetic cues, subtle score]. Duration: 15s. Resolution: 4K.
```

## T2. Product / Commercial

```
[Product] [action, e.g. rotates slowly on reflective surface] in [premium setting]. Camera: [orbital close-up with rack focus to logo]. Style: [clean minimal, premium lighting]. Lighting: [rim light with soft reflections]. Constraints: sharp focus, realistic materials, no artifacts. Audio: [satisfying click, ambient hum]. Duration: 10-15s. Resolution: 4K.
```

## T3. Character Portrait in Motion

```
[Character, detailed appearance] [subtle motion, e.g. turns slowly, hair moves in wind] in [intimate setting]. Camera: [slow dolly-in to close-up]. Style: [cinematic shallow DOF]. Lighting: [golden hour rim light]. Constraints: stable face, consistent clothing, natural proportions. Audio: [soft breathing, ambient wind]. Duration: 10s. Resolution: 4K.
```

## T4. Landscape / Environment

```
[Landscape scene] with [dynamic change, e.g. mist rolls in, light shifts] and [natural motion]. Camera: [sweeping aerial drone / slow parallax push]. Style: [hyper-realistic nature cinematography]. Lighting: [dramatic sunrise / golden hour volumetric rays]. Constraints: realistic water flow, believable atmospheric behavior. Audio: [wind, water, distant wildlife]. Duration: 15s. Resolution: 4K.
```

## T5. Action / VFX

```
[Subject] performs [action sequence] in [environment]. [00-05s] Establishing action. [05-10s] Signature hero effect (slow-motion, particle burst, stacked effects). [10-15s] Resolution beat. Camera: [long take / whip pan / tracking]. Style: [kinetic, particle effects, environmental destruction, fast-paced editing]. Lighting: [dramatic, high contrast]. Constraints: realistic impact physics, stable character proportions. Audio: [impact sounds, diegetic action]. Duration: 15s. Resolution: 4K.
```

## Usage

- Templates are scaffolds, not fill-in-the-blanks. Adapt phrasing to the specific concept.
- Include timeline brackets `[00-05s]` for multi-shot t2v prompts where beat control matters.
- Add constraints from `references/consistency-constraints.md` based on the shot's risk profile.
- Pull signature language from `references/style-families.md` to match the intended genre.
